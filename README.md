# **Power Generator Performance Prediction**

This project aims to predict the **net hourly electrical energy output** of power generators using machine learning. By leveraging environmental and operational data, the project will optimize generator performance, enhance energy management, and provide actionable insights for better decision-making.

## **Project Overview**

The project uses a dataset of environmental and operational parameters to train and evaluate four regression models. The goal is to determine the best model for predicting generator performance while ensuring scalability and reliability.

This is a group project, and every member plays a key role in ensuring its success by contributing to data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and documentation.

## **Objectives**

- **Predict energy output** based on key environmental factors.
- **Compare machine learning models** to identify the most effective one.
- **Provide insights** for improving operational efficiency.

---

## **Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for machine learning.
- **Model Development**: Training and comparing Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
- **Visualization**: Analyzing results and presenting insights through graphs and performance metrics.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive reporting of the methodology and findings.

## **Dataset**

The dataset includes the following features:
- **Avg Temperature**: Average ambient temperature.
- **Exhaust Vacuum**: Vacuum pressure from the exhaust system.
- **Ambient Pressure**: Atmospheric pressure at the site.
- **Relative Humidity**: Environmental humidity percentage.
- **Net Hourly Electrical Energy Output**: The target variable (energy output in kWh).

## **Machine Learning Models**

The following models will be developed and compared:
1. **Linear Regression**: Establishes a baseline for predictions.
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**: Captures non-linear relationships in the data.
3. **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble model that improves accuracy by reducing overfitting.
4. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: Provides state-of-the-art performance with fine-tuning.
